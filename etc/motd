Welcome to Tonix.
Type "help" to get a list of commands.
See "man <COMMAND>" or "help <COMMAND>" for more information.
Some options for certain commands work as well.
Feel free to navigate a pre-made file system using intuitive commands.
Path resolution mostly works.
Your feedback is greatly appreciated!
Have fun :)
