Welcome to Tonix.
Type "help" to get a list of commands.
"man <COMMAND>" or "help <COMMAND>" sometimes might be helpful.
Some options for certain commands work as well.
Feel free to navigate a pre-made file system using intuitive commands.
Path resolution does not work yet, one step at a time please.
Your feedback is highly appreciated!
Have fun :)
