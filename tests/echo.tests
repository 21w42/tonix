echo \nOverhead the albatross\nHangs motionless upon the air\nAnd deep beneath the rolling waves\nIn labyrinths of coral caves\nAn echo of a distant time\nComes willowing across the sand\nAnd everything is green and submarine\nAnd no one called us to the land\nAnd no one knows the where’s or why’s\nSomething stirs and something tries\nStarts to climb toward the light
echo \n\nStrangers passing in the street\nBy chance, two separate glances meet\nAnd I am you and what I see is me\nAnd do I take you by the hand\nAnd lead you through the land\nAnd help me understand the best I can?\nAnd no one calls us to move on\nAnd no one forces down our eyes\nNo one speaks and no one tries\nNo one flies around the sun
echo \n\nCloudless everyday\nYou fall upon my waking eyes\nInviting and inciting me to rise\nAnd through the window in the wall\nCome streaming in on sunlight wings\nA million bright ambassadors of morning\nAnd no one sings me lullabies\nAnd no one makes me close my eyes\nSo I throw the windows wide\nAnd call to you across the sky
