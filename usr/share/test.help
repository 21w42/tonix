    "description": "Exits with a status of 0 (true) or 1 (false) depending on the evaluation of EXPR.  Expressions may be unary or binary.  Unary\nexpressions are often used to examine the status of a file.  There are string operators and numeric comparison operators as well.\nThe behavior of test depends on the number of arguments.  Read the manual page for the complete specification.\nFile operators:",
    "options": "-a FILE        True if file exists.\n-b FILE        True if file is block special.\n-c FILE        True if file is character special.\n-d FILE        True if file is a directory.\n-e FILE        True if file exists.\n-f FILE        True if file exists and is a regular file.\n-g FILE        True if file is set-group-id.\n-h FILE        True if file is a symbolic link.\n-L FILE        True if file is a symbolic link.\n-k FILE        True if file has its `sticky' bit set.\n-p FILE        True if file is a named pipe.\n-r FILE        True if file is readable by you.\n-s FILE        True if file exists and is not empty.\n-S FILE        True if file is a socket.\n-t FD          True if FD is opened on a terminal.\n-u FILE        True if the file is set-user-id.\n-w FILE        True if the file is writable by you.\n-x FILE        True if the file is executable by you.\n-O FILE        True if the file is effectively owned by you.\n-G FILE        True if the file is effectively owned by your group.\n-N FILE        True if the file has been modified since it was last read.\nFILE1 -nt FILE2  True if file1 is newer than file2 (according to modification date).\nFILE1 -ot FILE2  True if file1 is older than file2.\nFILE1 -ef FILE2  True if file1 is a hard link to file2.\nAll file operators except -h and -L are acting on the target of a symbolic link, not on\nthe symlink itself, if FILE is a symbolic link.\nString operators:\n  -z STRING      True if string is empty.\n  -n STRING\n     STRING      True if string is not empty.\n  STRING1 = STRING2  True if the strings are equal.\n  STRING1 != STRING2 True if the strings are not equal.\n  STRING1 < STRING2  True if STRING1 sorts before STRING2 lexicographically.\n  STRING1 > STRING2  True if STRING1 sorts after STRING2 lexicographically.",

EXPR         True if expr is false.\nEXPR1 -a EXPR2 True if both expr1 AND expr2 are true.\nEXPR1 -o EXPR2 True if either expr1 OR expr2 is true.\n\narg1 OP arg2   Arithmetic tests.  OP is one of -eq, -ne, -lt, -le, -gt, or -ge.\n\nArithmetic binary operators return true if ARG1 is equal, not-equal, less-than, less-than-or-equal,\ngreater-than, or greater-than-or-equal than ARG2.",
